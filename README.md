  Added Task 1- Histogram and Bar Chart
   
Histogram od age distribution 
The The x-axis represents Age and the y-axis represents the Frequency (Count).
Most of the individuals fall within the 25–35 age range, indicating that the majority of the population belongs to a younger group.
The shape is close to a normal distribution, with more people in the middle age range and fewer on the extremes.

The bar chart represents the distribution of genders in the population.
The x-axis shows Gender categories (Male/Female) and the y-axis shows the Count of individuals.
The chart indicates that there are slightly more Males than Females in the dataset.
This highlights a small imbalance in the gender ratio of the sample population.
